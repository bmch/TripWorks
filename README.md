## TripWorks

TripWorks is an app that searches and aggregates accommodation, flight and weather data for travelers looking to streamline their travel planning experience, saving time and money. TripWorks gathers data for a list of destinations the user wishes to travel and ranks them based on the Trip score, in just a matter of minutes.

The app calculates a score based on the price of flights and hotels and targeted budget while it computes a score based on the weather forecast or historical climate data depending on dates of travel then returns a rating out of 10.
