TripWorks is an app that searches and aggregates accommodation, flight and weather data for travelers looking to streamline their travel planning experience, saving time and money. TripWorks gathers data for a list of destinations the user wishes to travel and ranks them based on the Trip score, in just a matter of minutes.

The app calculates a score based on the price of flights and hotels and targeted budget while it computes a score based on the weather forecast or historical climate data depending on dates of travel then returns a rating out of 10.
